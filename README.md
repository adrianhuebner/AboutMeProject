## Lab 3 ##
___
* Per the user stories, you will need to include in your HTML at _least one each of an ordered and an unordered list._
* Use _prompt_ for input and alert for output to the user, unless you are working on the third Stretch Goal.
* **_Do not write any functions in your JavaScript._**
* Expect that you will probably need both _‘for’_ and _‘while’_ structures for your sixth and seventh questions. But not necessarily.

## Stretch Goals:
___
* As a developer, I want to make my code more DRY by putting all of the questions, answers, and responses to the first five yes/no questions in my guessing game into arrays (or even one huge multidimensional array), and modifying the game logic such that a ‘for’ loop will control the flow from question to question.

* Make the number-guessing question use a random number as its correct answer.

* Audit your page’s accessibility. If you’ve already done this, audit your updated code, and work to improve your score. Test your HTML/CSS for accessibility with Chrome’s built-in Accessibility Auditing tool. Note that you’ll have to deploy your site somehow, and make some changes to your code to get the auditing tools to see your HTML code. You can disable the other audit checks when you run your audit. Include an image of your accessability report score in your submission’s README.md file.
